This is a fork of anvar's sbt-appengine-start, since I couldn't get it to work.

This is a template project for SBT 0.11.2 or newer that provides support for the following:

Google App Engine 1.6.1
Scalatra
Scalate
Specs2
IntelliJ IDEA Plugin for SBT
Jetty as the container

Use the following targets:

- gen-idea for generating idea templates
- container:start to start the Jetty container
- appengine:deploy for deploying to app engine
- ~prepare-webapp for quick development and code reload
